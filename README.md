# Alien Invasion
## A fully functional game showcasing OOP, and core HTML and CSS implementation focusing on CANVAS. 

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a spaceship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship left to right using arrow keys and shoot using the space bar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky, moving across and down the screen. The player's aim is to shoot and destroy the alien invaders! 

If the player destroys all of the alien ships then a new fleet appears, moving faster than the previous fleet. If an alien hits the player's ship, or if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, then the player loses a life. If the player loses three lives then it's game over.

* Use only core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks or packages
* Work with HTML Canvas and real-time collision detection
* Use of OOP to instantiate various in-game sprites in real-time 
* Custom UI
