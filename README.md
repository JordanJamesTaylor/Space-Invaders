In Alien Invasion, the player controls a space ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship left to right using the arrow jeys and shoot using the space bar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky, moving across and down the screen. The players aim is to shoot and destroy these alien invaders! 

If the player destroys all of the alien ships then a new fleet appears, moving faster than the previous fleet. If an alien hits the players ship, or if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, then the player loses a life. If the player loses three lives then it's game over. # alien-invasion
