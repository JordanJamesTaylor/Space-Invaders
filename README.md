In Alien Invasion, the player controls a space ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship left to right using the arrow jeys and shoot using the space bar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky, moving across and down the screen. The aim is to shoot and destroy all of the alien invaders!
